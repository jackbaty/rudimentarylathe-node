title: M.O.B.I.U.S. BBS
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

In the early 90s I set up a BBS using [[FirstClass BBS|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FirstClass]] and it was a blast. Hardly anyone showed up, but that was fine. It was fun just getting it all running.

I called it "M.O.B.I.U.S." which was a dorky, strained acronym for "Michigan Online Business Information User Service".
