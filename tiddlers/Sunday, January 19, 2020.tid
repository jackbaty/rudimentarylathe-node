I'm disappointed that McGregor didn't get his ass kicked. Guy's an asshole.

And now I've moved [[Copingmechanism.com]] to [[DigitalOcean]] via [[Cloudron]]

[[Roam]] automatically creates a page any time a link is used. This behavior is correct and I wish [[TiddlyWiki]] did the same.

Experiencing a renewed appreciation of [[fman]]. I wished that I could navigate its file listings with Emacs bindings and was surprised I couldn't. Then I remembered I'd already run into this and had created the [[EmacsNavigation Plugin for fman]]. Hurray for this wiki.
