I want to use Apple Notes for everything

I can't use Apple Notes for some things, because:

* No easy way to link to a note from other apps, say [[OmniFocus]]
* No easy way to create links //between// notes

[[This doesn't count|http://www.torgersons.com/life-hack-linking-to-a-specific-apple-note/]]

I think that's it. Stay tuned.
