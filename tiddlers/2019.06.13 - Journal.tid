`Light Rain, Mist, +57Â°F`

7:00 I don't like Face ID on the big iPad. Makes it hard to use when it's lying flat next to me on my desk. I have to lean over it to unlock.

14:59 If I'm being honest, I'd wager I'm considerably //less// productive using Emacs for tasks, email, and project notes. It's more fun and way cooler, but less productive.

15:13 What I'd love is Tinderbox on the iPad.
