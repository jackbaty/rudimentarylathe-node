ðŸŒ¨ +36Â°F

It snowed a little this morning.

I noticed I haven't posted to the blog in over a week. No reason. Just haven't felt like it.

The thing I've noticed about Linux is the sense of //agency// it gives me. I've never realized that was important until the last couple of macOS releases have started taking control away from me.
