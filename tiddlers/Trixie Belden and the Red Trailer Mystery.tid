My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2723049465">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Five stars because this is the first "real" book I ever read. 1970-ish. I read it while my parents and grandparents were out shopping and running errands. I made a sort of fort under my grandmother's kitchen table and just read and read.
