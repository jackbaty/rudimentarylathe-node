title: Quote: G. K. Chesterton on self
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

<<<
How much larger your life would be if your self could become smaller in it; if you could really look at other men with common curiosity and pleasure â€¦ You would break out of this tiny and tawdry theatre in which your own little plot is always being played, and you would find yourself under a freer sky, in a street full of splendid strangers.
<<<G. K. Chesterton
