title: 2019.01.28 - Using OmniFocus for a change
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

I need a fresh look at my tasks, so I'm going to use [[OmniFocus]] for a week or so. It's been a couple of years since I've used it in anger.

Moved all open tasks from [[OrgMode]] yesterday.

(I could have used my more recent standby [[Things.app]] but if we're going to change things up, let's really change them.)
