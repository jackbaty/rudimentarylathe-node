I've set up [[Cloudron]] and installed 4 apps so far: [[Monica]], [[Gitea]], [[Ghost]], and [[Surfer]]

It tickles me how much dark mode advocates say things like "bright white light shining in my face". It's not that bright. At all. I stand by my assertion that Dark Mode is a preference and a fad and only beneficial for a small number of people and has wasted vast amounts of developer resources.

If you're going to use email as 2nd factor, you'd better send the email quickly. Here I sit, waiting for the email, unable to log into my [[DigitalOcean]] account. UPDATE: My fault. I moved the baty.net domain to DigitalOcean but neglected to add MX records. That means I can't get email. That means I can't validate via email to log in and fix the MX records. Not good. UPDATE 2: I was still logged in on my work Mac so I could add the MX records and Whew!
