My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2700909895">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />

This was my second Jack Reacher novel. I enjoyed it, but I’m not sure how many more I’ll end up reading.

So many handy coincidences. So many conveniently attractive female characters, and of course they’re unable to resist the accidental charms of Mr. Reacher.

Much of it was fun and fast-paced, but the Eye Roll Factor was a little too high.
