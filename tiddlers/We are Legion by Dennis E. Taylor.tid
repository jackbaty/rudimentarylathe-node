My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2911822986">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I don't know how to feel about this one. The humor stopped helping somewhere around the half-way point, but there were some fun moments.<br /><br />The biggest issue was that much of it felt like I was listening to a first-person narration of the early Warcraft games.

Per [[recommendation by @dejus on Micro.blog|https://micro.blog/dejus/4718166]]

I'm hearing that the audio book is actually better than the printed edition, so I'm going to listen to this one via Audible
