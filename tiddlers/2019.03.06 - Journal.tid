6:42 Working at home today while I have "College H.U.N.K.S." (ha!) come and remove some junk at the house.

6:43 I want to keep project notes in Org-mode but I am finding that using TiddlyWiki is both more pleasant and more useful.

6:53 For each journal entry, I'm going to try embedding one of my photos. I don't plan to overthink it...just pick one at random from Flickr.

17:19 I started a new catalog in Capture One Pro today. I used to use Sessions but I think that was too limiting. This also means I have to reconsider my switch to Lightroom CC because I just don't like much about Lightroom, especially when compared with C1.

17:32 I am struggling a bit with deciding what goes in the wiki and what goes in [[TheBrain]]

21:24 Didn't know using [[winner-mode|https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WinnerMode]] in Emacs was going to be so easy.
