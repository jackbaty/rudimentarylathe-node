A few of the things I’m doing as of ''December 07, 2019''…

* (Still) Reading The Instructions, by Adam Levin. It's >1,000 pages cut me some slack!
* Building a simple darkroom in a basement bathroom
* Deciding what I want to be when I grow up
* Learning my way around [[Roam]] and trying to figure out what to do with it.
