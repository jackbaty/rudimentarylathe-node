Do you think your feed sucks because you follow too many accounts? You're in the right place!

If you're like me, you've followed a bajillion accounts over your years on Twitter dot com. Some of them date back to your first days as an egg â€” when you were probably an entirely different human being. You have some socially-obliged follow-backs sprinkled among some thought leaders you've outgrown, but you've never found the energy to go through and clean up your follows.
