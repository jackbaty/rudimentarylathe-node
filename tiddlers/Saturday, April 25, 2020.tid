[[DEVONthink]] is great, but I don't get enough use out of it. It's a glorified Finder most of the time. Files and folders can work nearly as well for my purposes. [[HoudahSpot]] helps.

I'm moving toward a feeling that I would like to be able to do most everything I //need// to do on a computer everywhere: Mac, iPad, Linux. (I don't care about doing things on a phone, but this doesn't rule it out). The Linux requirement really spoils it. This means relying on Emacs is out. Same with Things 3. I don't think this is compatible with my lifestyle or even possible to do properly.

I've made [[Firefox]] my default browser again. Partly due to better behavior with Roam, and partly due to what I was talking about in the previous paragraph. Consistency across devices and platforms where possible. Also, Firefox has the wonderful "Multi-containers" extension, among others. Oh, and Timimi, which lets me edit and save local TiddlyWiki files.

If I do end up switching back to Firefox, what about [[2020.04.22 - TW: Converted to node.js again]]? Makes less sense that way. Or rather, the whole do-everything-anywhere concept doesn't work with TiddlyWiki unless I go for the node version directly on the server. I was trying to avoid that, but `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
