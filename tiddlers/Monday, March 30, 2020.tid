I like this concept by [[Robin Sloan|https://www.robinsloan.com]]: "working with the garage door up". I can't find the original but it was attributed to Sloan by [[Andy Matuschak|https://andymatuschak.org]]. Anyway, that feels like what I'm doing here on this wiki. (Update: [[here's the source|https://desert.glass/newsletter/week-43/]]. Thanks [[Tully|http://tullyhansen.com]]!)
