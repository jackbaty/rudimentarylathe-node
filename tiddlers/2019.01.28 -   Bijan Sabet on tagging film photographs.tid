title: 2019.01.28 -   Bijan Sabet on tagging film photographs

Photographs made with film arenâ€™t necessarily better but they can be beautiful and meaningful. I think tagging exposes the merits of film and encourages people to try it. And the more we shoot with film, the longer it will be around.

This is exactly how I feel. I hear things like "It doesn't matter what was used. The only thing that matters is the photograph". Yeah yeah, whatever you say, Mr. Artist. I //like// knowing what film/camera/lens combination was used to create a photo. It's inspirational and encouraging. I tag mine because I like it when others tag theirs.
