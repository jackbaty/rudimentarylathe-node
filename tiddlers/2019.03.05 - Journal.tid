6:48 Driving on snowy, icy roads every morning is getting old.

6:56 I've noticed that recently I've been organizing this wiki according to how //I// want to find things and less so that //other// people can find them. I'm unsure if this is a bad idea, but since I consider this place to be mostly for my records, it feels like the right approach.

12:50 Playing with adding embedded images to tiddlers. Just for fun.
