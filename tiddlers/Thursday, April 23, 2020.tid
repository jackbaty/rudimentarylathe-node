I guess it's a sort of testament to [[Roam]] that people keep losing data but continue using it. I only experienced on small data glitch long ago, but for others it's been worse. We're all just assuming this will improve quickly and doing lots of backups!

My tiddler creation criteria has changed after integrating [[TiddlyBlink]] here. I find that I create smaller, more atomic tiddlers and use the "links" option for "View references as:". If each backlink shown links to a single-topic tiddler with a proper title, I don't need the in-context reference view.

When someone starts talking about renaming a product, the lurkers come out of the woodwork with thoughts.

I love the [[AirPods Pro]] but Spotify->AirPods is nothing compared to Roon FLAC->FiiO DAC->Sennheiser 650s. Not even close.

Looks like [[TiddlyBlink]] is now [[Stroll]]. I'm ok with that. [[Here's the thread|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tiddlywiki/MF8PtDUA-G8]]
