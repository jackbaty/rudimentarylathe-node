title: Extract Key and cert from PFX SSL file
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

I sometimes receive SSL keys as .pfx files, which I don't want. Here's how to split them up...

```
openssl pkcs12 -in myfile.pfx -nocerts -out private-key.pem -nodes
openssl pkcs12 -in myfile.pfx -nokeys -out certificate.crt
```
