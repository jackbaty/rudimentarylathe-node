[[Todoist|https://todoist.com/]] is a nicely-designed, cross-platform task manager. I've tried using it on a few occasions, but it's never felt like "enough" for me.

!!! Pro
* Looks good
* Quick entry is great
* Cross-platform

!!! Con

* No "Start Date" or "Defer Until". I don't know how to use a task manager without this.
