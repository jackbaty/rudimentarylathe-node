Safari has always been my favorite browser. I often try [[Firefox]] but always end up back with my default.

I prefer the behavior of 1Password X in Firefox to that of the 1Password browser extension in Safari.

Pinned tabs work the way I expect them to in Safari.

Can't edit standalone TiddlyWiki files. :(
