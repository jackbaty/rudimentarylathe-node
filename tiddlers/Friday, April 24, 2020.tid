[[We|https://fusionary.com]] originally moved our source/deployment projects to [[Gitlab]] because it was much much cheaper for hosting private repos. Now, the prices are comparable, so I've been re-evaluating [[Github]] as an option. Github feels nicer in just about every way. It's amazing how two products that do basically the same things in the same way can //feel// so much different. Github is tighter, cleaner, and faster. Sigh.
