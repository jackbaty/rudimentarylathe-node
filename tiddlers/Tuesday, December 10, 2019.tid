I'm setting up an EKS cluster in AWS and wow the things I don't know about Kubernetes!

Once in a while I become bored with [[Emacs]] and think I'm going to leave
it completely. What always ends up happening is that two weeks later I
open it in order to find some Orgmode thing and am immediately wanting
to jump back in. I mean, it's so good at so much, right? Also, I know
where everything is. It's in Emacs! Somewhere. So then I think that
maybe I'll just journal and write documents in Emacs and no longer do
email/RSS/Tasks, etc. But then I'm in there and making a new task is
easy as C-c c and done. But then how do I get tasks from MailMate into
Orgmode? So I'm off on a tangent writing little scripts to help with
that. I get frustrated with the hassle so I re-install Mu4e and there
we are.
