My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2846592850">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
The first 300 pages were fantastic. Then the story delved further into bitworld and became less interesting to me. Many reviews said that the last part of the book was almost entirely a fantasy novel within bitworld, so I gave up at around page 500 and will not be finishing the book.<br /><br />This is disappointing, because the first 3rd was so very good.
