My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2787535594">2 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Putting this aside for now. I keep thinking, "Well that was a lot of words not saying much." I'm half-way through it so maybe it'll add up to something. So far it reads like an all-over-the-map academic hippy manifesto without benefit of an editor. I'll probably be accused of "not getting it" and so be it.
