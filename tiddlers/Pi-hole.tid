title: Pi-hole
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

[[Pi-hole|https://pi-hole.net/]] is "A black hole for Internet advertisements"

I'm running it on a [[Raspberry Pi]]

I have decided to configure devices independently rather than forcing every device (via DHCP) to use the Pi-hole. Worried that false positives will break things for family just trying to enjoy the internet.
