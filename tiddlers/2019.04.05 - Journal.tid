7:01 Back in the office today, but pretend I'm not here.

10:44 org-journal's search in [[Doom-emacs]] is broken. For now I've switched to my home-grown emacs.d/, with the addition of `evil-mode`

10:46 I disliked using my MBP's keyboard so much this past week that I've gone back to hedging my bets against Apple. e.g. using Firefox, TiddlyWiki, Emacs, and org-journal so that I can more easily switch to another OS at some point. How the hell did it come to this?
