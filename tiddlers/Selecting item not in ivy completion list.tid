title: Selecting item not in ivy completion list

When, for example, I want to rename a file in `dired` to something not in the completion list but that happens to match an existing file, hitting return will choose one of the existing items. I don't want that.

The trick is `ivy-immediate-done` which is bound to `C-M-j` (aka `Control-Alt-j`). This will use whatever is in the prompt and not one of the matches.
