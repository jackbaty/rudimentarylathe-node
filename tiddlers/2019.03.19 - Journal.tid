6:50 My thoughts and opinions are so watered down by those of others that I'm no longer sure what I think about things. Consumption is dangerous to original thought.

10:33 I've been really enjoying [[Qobuz]]  and it's made me review my digital listening options. I wanted a DAC and DAP and so ordered a [[FiiO M9 DAP]]. Now for some better portable headphones.

19:14 I just spent 3 hours getting my [[mu4e]] setup back to working with Doom and I'm not sure it's worth the trouble. I love the //idea// of managing my email in Emacs but to be honest it's kind of a PITA.

20:18 None of the things about my workflow(s) that I plan for end up actually happening. I feel like I could use TextEdit, Reminders, Photos, and Safari and be just as effective.
