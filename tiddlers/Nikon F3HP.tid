I bought my [[Nikon F3HP|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_F3]] in 2016. It's a wonderful brick of a camera. With the motor drive attached, it's more like a stack of bricks.

Produced between 1980 and 2000, the F3 was a professional workhorse camera for 20 years.

I keep the motor drive attached, even though it's bulky and adds to the weight. I love the way it handles, though. Big, solid, and confidence inspiring. Plus, the whirring shutter sound makes me happy.
