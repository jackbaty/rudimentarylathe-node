title: 2019.01.10 - Wiki: Problems saving with Safari
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Alluvasudden I can't save an HTML copy of the wiki using [[Safari]]. Instead there's some crazy "Can't open file 'blob:3423432nonsense...'

Not sure if it's just at my office Mac or something else. Will need to check at home.
