7:34 Still figuring out my photo management situation. After 2 days of confusion and restarting the whole Lightroom Classic/Lightroom CC combination, I almost went back to Capture One and Photos. Instead I've deleted the entire CC library and am rebuilding the Classic library and I am so in trouble.

10:24 See, the thing is, I don't like posting single photos to baty.blog. And I don't much like putting title-less microblog posts there either. Never have. I've been using a theme that blends them in a way that I don't hate, but it's still not comfortable.

11:35 And I've switched themes for my blog back to a forked "Default" theme. Way easier to read, if I'm being honest. Also, I paid for a year of micro.blog and will go back to posting quick photos and micro-type posts there. I've been posting way fewer microblog type posts since Rudimentary Lathe arrived.
