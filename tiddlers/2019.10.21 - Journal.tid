Oh man, now I'm researching image management, raw converters, etc for Linux because I HATE MYSELF. Ok, that's not why. I am, however, interested in if doing photo work on Linux is possible without mentioning the horror that was GIMP last time I tried this. Some interesting options are [[Darktable|https://www.darktable.org]], [[DigiKam|https://www.digikam.org]], [[Shotwell|https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Shotwell]], and [[Rapid Photo Downloader|https://www.damonlynch.net/rapid/]]
