The following sounds correct but isn't...

Seriously, who cares when anything on my site got posted. For the vast majority of things I'm writing it makes absolutely no difference what-so-ever.

I only have two or three dogs left to live.

On [[Friday, April 24, 2020]] I said "Fuck it, I'm using Roam". And I did. Until... I lost some data again. Lots of other people are losing data. Maybe most importantly, the more I see of it, the less I want to be associated with [[#roamcult|https://twitter.com/hashtag/roamcult]]. Also Conor White-Sullivan [[digs Conor McGregor|https://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1254656948072398848]] and I don't think it's because they have the same first names. This speaks poorly of his taste in human beings. Let's just say the whole thing is putting me off. There are many smart, interesting people using and talking about Roam, but they are being drowned out by the "Smart" set (the quotes were deliberate). Maybe the ratio will change some day.

I don't normally avoid products or art simply because the creator is "problematic". It takes a significant set of abhorrent behaviors before I can no longer separate a creator from their creations. For example, I will always love "Manhattan" even though Woody Allen is iffy. I still find Louis CK hilarious. On the other hand, I grew up laughing at Bill Cosby records but I find that harder now. On other words, I don't cancel everyone the internet tells me I should. I use my best personal judgement.
