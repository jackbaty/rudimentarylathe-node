Here is a list of sites I visit (actually visit) on a regular basis, either because they don't have an RSS feed or I just prefer interacting with the sites rather than via a feed. 

!! Wikis

The following wikis tend to be updated regularly, and so merit visiting often.

* [[h0p3|https://philosopher.life]] - A wonderful example of life-logging in TiddlyWiki. His is the site that inspired me to create this wiki.
* [[Phil N|https://youneedastereo.com/]] - A kindred spirit: Emacs, TiddlyWiki, Tinderbox, workflows, etc.
* [[Sphygmus|https://sphygm.us/]] - Another life-logging TiddlyWiki.
* [[Frank Mcpherson|https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors]]
* [[Josh Sullivan|https://joshisms.io/]] Another kindred spirit, now with a new TiddlyWiki!

!! Not Wikis
* [[Nadia Eghbal|https://nadiaeghbal.com/notes/]] - notes
* [[Micro.blog|https://micro.blog]] - Of course, because I live there now.
* [[Twitter|https://twitter.com/]] - Don't @ me
* [[Allsides.com|https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news]] - an attempt at "balanced" news.
