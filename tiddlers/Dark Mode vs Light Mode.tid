NN/g's conclusion about [[Dark Mode vs. Light Mode: Which Is Better?|https://www.nngroup.com/articles/dark-mode/]]...

<<<
While dark mode may present some advantages for some low-vision users â€” in particular, those with cloudy ocular media such as cataract, the research evidence points in the direction of an advantage of positive polarity for normal-vision users. In other words, in users with normal vision, light mode leads to better performance most of the time.
