I still like using [[Fish Shell]]. It does so many useful things, straight out of the box. Yes, one could make bash or zsh do many of the same things, but it's work getting there. Work I'm not interested in.

The [[Apple Magic Keyboard for iPad]] is the greatest thing to happen to the iPad and to my use of iOS.
