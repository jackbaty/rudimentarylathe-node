[[Postbox|https://www.postbox-inc.com/]] Email client for Mac and Windows.

I used Postbox back in early 2010s but didn't record why I stopped. Now that I'm also using Windows, it came up again. I took the lifetime license upgrade offer ($28) and have configured it on both my Mac and Windows boxes.

It's full-featured, certainly.
