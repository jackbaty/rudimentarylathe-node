I changed my filename prefix from ISO date to a compressed YYYYMMDD format and now I'm finding them harder to read. e.g. `20200110`. I think I have to change it back to `2020-01-10`. Joy.

I still don't know what this wiki is for. It's not really a wiki anymore, and I already have places to write blog posts. The "rudimentary lathe" idea still makes sense, I guess.

Gotta get back into the darkroom. I haven't made a print since October.
