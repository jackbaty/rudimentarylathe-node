title: 2019.01.07 - Changed the Journal entry titles
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

I've changed the date format from `YYYY-MM-DD - Journal` to `YYYY.MM.DD - Journal` because the period is narrower but the date is just as easy to read.

This led to a blog post: [[Changing my default date format|https://www.baty.blog/2019/date-formats]]
