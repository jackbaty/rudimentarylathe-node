title: 2020.02.09 - Back to static HTML

I've waffled on this many times, but since I'm moving this wiki to a new server and I don't feel like installing node/tiddlywiki there, I'm publishing it directly as an HTML file via Caddy. Easy peasy for hosting, but means I need to run and edit the original in Firefox locally, then rsync it up to the server. I have a simple Makefile for that, but it still feels more removed from the actual published version than I like. Giving it a whirl, though.
