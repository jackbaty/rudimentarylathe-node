I promised myself that when I sold my house I'd use some of the proceeds and buy a [[Peloton|https://www.onepeloton.com/]] exercise bike. So I did.

I'm in terrible shape, so the first dozen rides made me feel like I wanted to die. But after that, things started to turn, and I'm feeling much better during rides now. I hope to average 3 rides per week.
