I'm thinking of publishing this wiki as a standalone HTML file rather than running it as a Node app. If you're reading this, I've done just that. [[2020.02.09 - Back to static HTML]]

Not every film is meant to be a moral compass.

I let my [[1Password]] subscription expire. Guess I'm all-in with [[Bitwarden]] now.

I updated my baty.net blog (Hugo) and posted a couple things there yesterday. Can you tell I'm feeling "static" again?

In my subscription purge, I've canceled [[YNAB]]. That's $50/year I can live without. This may mean I fire up [[Ledger]] again. Hooboy.

Yep, I got Ledger all set up. [[Ledger-mode|https://github.com/ledger/ledger-mode]] helps. This time I'm going to need to try and get some imports from CSV working better. That was always a pain last time I tried this.
