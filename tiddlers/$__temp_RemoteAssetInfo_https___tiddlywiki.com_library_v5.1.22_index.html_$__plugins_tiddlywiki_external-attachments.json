        "readme": "! Introduction\n\nThis plugin provides support for importing tiddlers as external attachments. That means that instead of importing binary files as self-contained tiddlers, they are imported as \"skinny\" tiddlers that reference the original file via the ''_canonical_uri'' field. This reduces the size of the wiki and thus improves performance. However, it does mean that the wiki is no longer fully self-contained.\n\n! Compatibility\n\nThis plugin only works when using TiddlyWiki with platforms such as TiddlyDesktop that support the ''path'' attribute for imported/dragged files.\n\n",
