title: Quote: Planning the day - E.B. White
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

<<<
If the world were merely seductive, that would be easy. If it were merely challenging, that would be no problem. But I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.
<<<E.B. White
