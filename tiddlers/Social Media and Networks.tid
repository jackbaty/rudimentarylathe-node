[[Smokey Ardisson suggests|https://micro.blog/smokey/1732231]] social networks such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] are "sort of like IE 6, uncomfortable, dominant, and stagnant."

I like this analogy. I'd extend it by including that the big social networks are entrenched by being the ubiquitous, simple, default option.
