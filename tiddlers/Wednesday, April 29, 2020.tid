ðŸŒ¦ Light Rain, Mist +57Â°F

I like walking the dog, but not in a downpour. We'll dry off eventually.

Am I allowed to run Linux even if I don't have a half-naked, pre-teen anime character as my desktop image?

I'm not paying for [[Roam]] until there's a native `blockquote` and not some convoluted hiccup hack. Oh, and yeah, no data loss.

Replacing text in [[Emacs]] with a newline character is stupid: `C-M-% [REPLACED STRING] C-q C-j` Why can't I just use `\n`?

A friend of mine had QuarkXpress so he did //everything// in it from detailed machine drawings to simple text memos. Reminds me of everyone in the Roam slack channel. ;)

I've been using the default browser-based email interfaces for Gmail and Fastmail this week and so far I've confirmed that I truly dislike Gmail's.

Why does seemingly every article or video about making contact sheets show them cutting negatives into strips of 6 and then making the contact sheet on 8x10 paper. It doesn't fit, yet nothing is said. Even [[Ilford does it|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E03MP5nWJPs]]
