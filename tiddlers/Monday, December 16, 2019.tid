Instead of phone users forcing web developers to change everything to accomodate useless, tiny little screens, web developers should design websites that completely suck on mobile and force people to use real computers<<footnote "Ha!" "Hahahaha! I'm hilarious">>

I've officially stopped loving The Mandalorian. For a while I thought its episodic nature was refreshing but now I'm feeling it's repetitive and a teensy bit boring.
