title: 2019.04.10 - Daybook meal log badges
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

In my [[Tinderbox]] daybook, I track meals and record a "Quality" for each; Low, Medium, or High. Each entry then displays a `$Badge` based on the quality value

I was using a set of `if` statements until I learned that Tinderbox has [[Look-up Tables|https://www.acrobatfaq.com/atbref7/index/ActionsRules/Look-uptables.html]] which act as associative arrays.

I added a user attribute `QualityBadgeList` of type "set". For the agent (named "Set Quality Badge") which sets the badges, I added the following `$QualityBadgeList` value:

"High:ðŸ¥‡;Medium:ðŸ¥ˆ;Low:ðŸ¥‰"

The agent now uses the look-up table to set the badge...

```
$Badge=$QualityBadgeList("Set Quality Badge").at($Quality);
```

This is likely faster and is definitely easier to maintain.
