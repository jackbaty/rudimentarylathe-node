I would like to try using Ivy rather than Helm for completion. 


[[This Reddit thread|https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/51lqn9/helm_or_ivy/]] has a lot of useful tips.

This should come in handy:

''Frequently asked questions''

Q: How do I enter an input that matches one of the candidates instead of this candidate? Example: create a file bar when a file barricade exists in the current directory.

A: Press `C-M-j`. Alternatively, you can make the prompt line selectable with (setq ivy-use-selectable-prompt t).
