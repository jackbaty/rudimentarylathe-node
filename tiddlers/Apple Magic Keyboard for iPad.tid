title: Apple Magic Keyboard for iPad
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

I've been using Apple's new Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro for a few days and it's wonderful. My feelings about using the iPad have gone from "Fine, if I have to" to "Well now, this is really nice!". Editing more than a Tweet's worth of text on iOS is now possible.
