ðŸŒ¦ Light Rain +42Â°F

Finally dealt with the hero image conundrum on [[Copingmechanism.com]]. I like the thumbnails on the index page but don't always want to see that image also on the post itself. Fixed, thanks to [[this post|https://hooshmand.net/ghost-blog-different-hero-image-feature-image/]]
