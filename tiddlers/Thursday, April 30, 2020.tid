ðŸŒ¦ Light Rain +46Â°F

There's nothing "uncertain" about these times, I'm certain they suck.

The reason I have such a conflict about using [[Roam]] is that, although its founder and culture (RoamCult, gag) aren't my favorite, the tool itself is demonstrably better than anything else I've used or am aware of. TiddlyWiki is great, but not the same. Emacs with Org-roam is clever and ticks the privacy and longevity boxes, but is harder to use and requires me to //actively// work with my notes. Roam lets me //passively// work with notes and just magically surfaces things in a way that's easier to use and easier on the senses than the others. I hate being in this situation. At the moment, Roam's positives outweigh its negatives. Its negatives right now include the potential of data loss, which hints at how far I'm willing to go so that I can keep the positives.
