I have a couple of digital private journals (one in Day One and one in [[Org-Journal]]) and a paper notebook journal. These are all terrific, so why do I feel like putting everything I write into this silly wiki instead? It's certainly not private here, but there's something compelling about the //possibility// that someone will stumble across things I've written here, even if they weren't meant to be seen by anyone but me. Still hashing all this out, I guess.
