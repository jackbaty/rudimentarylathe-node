title: 2019.01.16 - Dropbox error when upgrading on Manjaro
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

I was getting some sort of "pgp key not trusted" error when upgrading Dropbox on my Thinkpad.

I changed /etc/resolv.conf to use 1.1.1.1 for dns and all was well

This happened again and I had to add the dropbox key...

gpg --recv-keys THEKEYFROMERRORMSG
