Reported bugs in both [[Doom-emacs]] and [[Org-roam]] yesterday and both were fixed overnight. Nice.

I'm beginning to feel like Org-roam is good enough and //could// take the place of [[Roam]] itself if I keep my expectations in line. Here's [[what I posted about org-roam|https://www.baty.net/2020/org-roam/]] over the weekend.

The only place where dealing with notes doesn't give me a headache is in a paper notebook.

I've been on a pencil kick again recently, so it was fun listening to [[Brian Mackenwells on The Boring Talks|https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p082m38f]] saying nice things about pencils. Things like [[Brian Mackenwells on The Boring Talks podcast|Quote: Brian Mackenwells on pencils]]
